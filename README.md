# USB Booster Pack
## For F28069 and F28377S LaunchPads
The [TMS320F28069U](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-f28069m) and  [TMS320F28377S](http://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-F28377S) microcontrollers both have USB D+ and D- pins directly on the chip. This Booster Pack provides a Female USB B connecter as well an input selection jumper, for easier connection to the USB pins.

## Firmware Examples
TI provides many examples for these two microcontrollers in their ControlSuite software. It is freely available online [here](http://www.ti.com/tool/controlsuite).

## Note
The USB connection on the booster pack **does not** supply voltage to the LaunchPad via the 3V3 or 5V pins.
